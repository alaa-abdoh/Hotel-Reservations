# ðŸ”¥ Hotel Reservation App ðŸ”¥
Welcome to my project! It's great to have you here. ðŸ˜‰

I built this project at the end of my training trip at Foothill Company. This is training on everything that was learned in the educational trip. The project is a display of hotels from different parts of the world so that the user enters the site and searches for the destination he wants to go to and books a hotel there.
The hotels in the target area and the features of each hotel are displayed 
Special pages have been created for users and special pages for admins to control the site
## To enter the site as a user:
Username: user
Password:user
## To enter the site as an admin 
Username: admin
Password: admin

Skills:HTML, CSS, react, jsx, typeScript
